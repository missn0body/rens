# rens
Big Brother renames your files.  
Created in 2024 by anson.

This program was created to solve a specific problem I had while
working at an imaging institution as a student associate, processing
thousands of MRI images, which usually had wonky names. I had wanted
to rename a bunch of files to the same format but also append a number
to each file in a foldr to ensure uniqueness.

So I created this utility to solve my specific problem and I hope that
someone else can also find this useful.

Usage and options can be read by invoking `rens --help` at the
command line. This project is licensed under the MIT License, See
